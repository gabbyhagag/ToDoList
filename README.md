# ToDoList-Isracard

I am using the Dotnet core 3.1 Web API with React SPA.
These run into the same Visual Studio project.

ToDoList stand on a session users, you can add new missions with title and image, looking at all other users' tasks - "public missions." handling errors from the server, necessary validations at server & client.
